V0.9
Added:
-Metaballs (CreateFluid and CreateBlob)
-MD2 support (transitional animations are not yet supported)
-Manual animation (mode 4): it's now possible the bones of an animated mesh, and the mesh will deform
-Pre-rendered mesh animations: when a mesh is copied using RepeatMesh, all frames of the animation are rendered and stored in video memory, to be used for every instance of the mesh: animation is less smooth, but if many animated meshes are rendered at the same time, less system resources are used


-Fixed
-Some bugs in Octrees
-SpriteRenderMode now works
-Geosphere LOD works better
-Upgraded image loader
-Removed all the glBegin..glEnd pairs from the code: now, compiling for GLES should be easier


V0.8
Added:
- ClearCollisions
- Geospheres: now it's possible to make planets (spherical terrains)
Fixed:
- Collisions of child entities now works
- if an entity has no parent, GeTParent returns 0: also, EntityParent ent,0 now works
- AnimLength

V0.7
Added:
- Octrees
- Dynamic collisions (a sphere-to-sphere collision is detected even if both objects are moving)
- VBO automatically disabled for older OpenGL version.

Fixed:
- Some memory leaks when a mesh is loaded or copied
- RepeatMesh: repeated meshes can be used in collisions.
- X and 3ds loader: surfaces were loaded twice.

V0.62
Added:
-Can load some DirectX (.x) files

Fixed:
-Hiding an entity will hide its shadow, too

V0.6

Added:
- CameraToTex: cubemapping will be easier.
- Constructive Solid Geometry: with command MeshCSG it's possible to combine, subtract or intersect two meshes
- Stencils: things like mirrors or portals are possible
- UVW mapping: with the command UpdateTexCoords, the second texture map of a surface will be replaced with a UVW texture map, to apply materials (3D textures)
- Materials: they are 3d textures, that can be stored in multiframe pictures (just like animated textures: they can be load with a similar syntax). Materials cannot be used on a surface directly, but they can be used in a shader template that can be applied to a surface. UVW data will be used to map it.
- Voxel sprites: they are solid, and can be created from a material (as a 2D sprite can be created from a texture)

Fixed:
- a bug in TFormPoint: it didn't work correctly when a source entity and a destination entity were specified at the same time
- a cubemap bug.
- Some memory leaks (Thank D.J.Peters)
- a bug in shadows: distance from the light was not computed correctly.

V0.5

Added:
- Shader support
- Command RepeatMesh: creates a new mesh using surfaces of another one: any change to surface of one mesh will affect its clones, too.
- LightRange now affects shadows, too.
- MeshCullRadius now works
- LoadAnimTextures now can extract frames from more than one strip.

Fixed:
- fixed a bug in FreeEntity that caused memory leaks
- Shadow anomalies: should be fixed
- Mesh attached to animated bones were updated only when the animated mesh was turned/moved. Fixed.
- CreateCylinder (solid mode)
- EntityParent: when parenting to 0, scale was not restored
- TranslateEntity: it worked in the wrong way. Fixed.
- MeshesIntersect: fixed
- Cleaned the source (thanks to D.J. Peters)
- CopyEntity terrain: if entitytype was set, it crashed. Fixed.
- CopyEntity terrain: now brush info are copied, too.
