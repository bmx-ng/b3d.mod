Blitzmax Openb3d library collection

#### Newton Dynamics ####

Blitzmax library wrapper for Newton dynamics v3.13. Newton v3.13 source is included in the module but can also be found on <a href="https://github.com/MADEAPPS/newton-dynamics/releases">Github</a>.

The wrapper is not ready for use yet.

#### License ####

Both the library and wrapper are licensed with the zlib license.

#### Assimp (Open Asset Import) ####

BlitzMax library wrapper for Assimp v3.1.1.

Assimp is included with the module and uses [Boost](http://www.boost.org/users/history/) so [BaH.Boost](https://github.com/maxmods/bah.mod) is required, there is currently no Boost workaround option but bear in mind this has no threads. 

The wrapper is now a source import and can load meshes from streams allowing incbin or zipstream. Animations are not implemented and it does not work in 64-bit yet.

#### License ####

Both the library and wrapper are licensed with the 3-clause BSD license.
